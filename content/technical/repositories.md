# Code Repositories

The WHG codebase is divided into several GitHub repositories, each with a specific focus:

* [Web Site](https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/website)

This repository contains the codebase for the WHG v3.0b application. It is a Django-based web application that provides
a user interface for uploading, reconciling, and publishing historical gazetteer data.

* [Tile Server](https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/tileboss)

This repository contains the codebase for generation and serving of map tiles for the WHG application. **Its
functionality will soon be integrated into the WHG PLACE repository.**

* [WHG PLACE (v4)](https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/place) (Place Linkage, Alignment, and Concordance Engine)

This repository contains the Kubernetes server configuration files for deploying and managing the World Historical
Gazetteer (WHG) application in the forthcoming Version 4. It provides a dedicated space for configuring and orchestrating the server environment.
