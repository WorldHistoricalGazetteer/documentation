# Part 7: Summary & Future Extensions

## 1. Model Summary

### 1.1 Core Architecture

The World Historical Gazetteer data model achieves a clean separation between:

**Conceptual entities** (what things are):
- **Subject**: Places, periods, routes, itineraries, networks, collections
- **Name**: Labels with semantic types, language/script metadata, vector embeddings
- **Geometry**: Spatial representations with derived fields for efficient querying
- **Timespan**: Temporal bounds following PeriodO's four-field model

**Evidentiary claims** (what we know about them):
- **Attestation**: Relationships between entities, with sources, certainty, and temporal context

This architecture provides:
- **Flexibility**: Same model handles diverse contribution types
- **Provenance**: Every claim explicitly sourced
- **Temporality**: Time-awareness throughout via Timespan linkages
- **Scalability**: Graph structure scales to millions of entities and relationships

---

### 1.2 Key Design Decisions

**Unified Subject model**:
- Single entity type replaces Place/Group distinction
- Atomic vs. compositional determined by attestations, not schema
- Accommodates places, periods, routes, itineraries, networks seamlessly

**Timespan as first-class entity**:
- Removes temporal fields from Attestation
- Enables PeriodO integration as external Timespan references
- Supports multiple conflicting temporal claims
- Allows temporal inheritance and computation

**Attestation-based relationships**:
- All connections via attestations (not embedded fields)
- Enables multiple sources for same claim
- Supports meta-attestations (attestations about attestations)
- Facilitates temporal dynamics (relationships changing over time)

**Namespaced identifiers**:
- Compact representation (`pleiades:579885` vs. full URL)
- Preserves external authority IDs
- WHG-minted DOIs for contributions
- Django-managed namespace resolution

**Source arrays**:
- Multiple sources can support single attestation
- Acknowledges collaborative evidence-building
- Enables source comparison and quality assessment

**Vector embeddings**:
- Required for Name entities (not optional)
- Enables cross-linguistic toponymic matching
- Critical for Dynamic Clustering Workflow
- Supports semantic search across scripts

**Derived geometric fields**:
- `representative_point`, `bbox`, `hull` pre-computed
- Enables efficient spatial clustering
- Supports fast bounding box queries
- Facilitates geometry inheritance

### 1.3 What the Model Achieves

✅ **Temporal gazetteering**: Not just where, but when was it called X and where was it then
✅ **Source transparency**: Every claim traceable to evidence
✅ **Multiple perspectives**: Conflicting sources represented, not synthesized
✅ **Cross-cultural support**: Multilingual, multi-script with phonetic and semantic matching
✅ **Network/route modeling**: Beyond points to connections and movements
✅ **Contribution flexibility**: LPF, CSV, GPX, edge lists all mappable
✅ **DOI integration**: Dataset-level attribution and citability
✅ **PeriodO alignment**: Standard period definitions as Timespan entities
✅ **Dynamic clustering support**: Indexes and fields optimized for similarity grouping
✅ **Geometry inheritance**: Territories computed from constituent regions
✅ **Vespa-optimized**: Single system for storage, indexing, querying

## 2. Comparison with Other Models

### 2.1 vs. Linked Places Format (LPF)

**LPF** (interchange format):
- Document-oriented (places as standalone GeoJSON features)
- Temporal data embedded in properties
- Human-readable, contribution-friendly
- Limited relationship expressivity

**WHG internal model**:
- Graph-oriented (entities linked via attestations)
- Temporal data as separate Timespan entities
- Query-optimized, analytically powerful
- Rich relationship vocabulary with CIDOC-CRM alignment

**Relationship**: Bidirectional transformation maintains interoperability while enabling advanced internal queries.

---

### 2.2 vs. Recogito

**Recogito** (annotation-focused):
- Lightweight place references in texts
- Annotations link texts to place authorities
- Web annotation model

**WHG**:
- Comprehensive gazetteer with full place records
- Attestations link entities to each other and to evidence
- Broader scope (not just textual annotations)

**Complementary**: Recogito can use WHG reconciliation; WHG can ingest Recogito annotations.

---

### 2.3 vs. Pleiades

**Pleiades** (authoritative ancient places):
- Curated, high-quality ancient Mediterranean/Near East
- Editorial workflow with expert review
- Comprehensive connections and attestations

**WHG**:
- Aggregates multiple gazetteers including Pleiades
- Broader temporal/geographic scope
- Lower barrier to contribution
- Reconciliation across authorities

**Relationship**: WHG indexes Pleiades and links to it via `same_as` attestations.

---

### 2.4 vs. GeoNames

**GeoNames** (modern place names):
- Massive contemporary gazetteer
- Minimal historical depth
- Hierarchical administrative structure
- Free, widely used

**WHG**:
- Historical focus with temporal awareness
- Multiple names over time
- Source-based attestations
- Network/route support

**Relationship**: WHG indexes GeoNames for modern places, extends with historical data.

---

## 3. Possible Future Extensions

### 3.1 Enhanced Attestation Types

**Uncertain relationships**:
- `possibly_same_as`: Low-confidence equivalence claims
- `probably_member_of`: Likely but unconfirmed membership
- `likely_connected_to`: Hypothesized network connections

**Causal relationships**:
- `caused_by`: Historical causation (e.g., plague → population decline)
- `influenced`: Cultural/political influence patterns

**Temporal relationships**:
- `contemporary_with`: Co-existence assertions
- `precedes`/`follows`: Temporal ordering beyond succession

---

### 3.2 Meta-Attestations

**Attestations about attestations**:
- Scholarly critique of existing claims
- Provenance chains (who attested based on whose work)

{
  "subject_type": "attestation",
  "subject_id": "whg:attestation-troy-location",
  "relation_type": "challenges",
  "object_type": "attestation",
  "object_id": "whg:attestation-troy-homer",

## 6. Conclusion

The World Historical Gazetteer v4 data model represents a significant advance in historical place data infrastructure. By:

- Separating conceptual entities from evidentiary attestations
- Treating temporality as a first-class concern via Timespan entities
- Supporting diverse contribution types (gazetteers, routes, itineraries, networks)
- Enabling source transparency and multiple perspectives
- Optimizing for both human contribution and machine querying
- Integrating with established standards (PeriodO, CIDOC-CRM, LPF)

...the model provides a foundation for rich historical research, teaching, and public engagement with the geographic dimensions of the past.

The attestation-based architecture ensures that WHG is not just a database of places, but a knowledge graph of historical geographic claims—with provenance, temporality, and uncertainty explicitly modeled. This positions WHG uniquely among gazetteer projects as a platform for critical historical inquiry, not merely place name lookup.

Future extensions will deepen analytical capabilities (network analysis, ML integration) while maintaining the core principles of evidence-based scholarship, temporal awareness, and cross-cultural representation that distinguish WHG from both commercial mapping platforms and generalist knowledge bases.
