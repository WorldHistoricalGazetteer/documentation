# Future Extensions

Here are some potential future extensions for the phonetic place name matching system:

- **Transliteration fallback**: For scripts without Epitran support (e.g., cuneiform).
- **User feedback loop**: Capture "did you mean?" corrections to improve training data.
- **Speech-to-text integration**: Allow audio queries (spoken place names).
