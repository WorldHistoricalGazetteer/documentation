# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the World Historical Gazetteer in minutes.

## Note to Documentation Team

This should be a concise, task-oriented introduction. Consider:
- Target completion time: 10-15 minutes
- Include screenshots at key steps
- Focus on the "aha moment" - getting users to see value quickly
- Three primary user pathways: searcher/browser, data contributor, researcher
- Consider video walkthrough to accompany this page
- Include links to more detailed documentation for each step
- Test with actual new users and iterate based on confusion points

## What is the World Historical Gazetteer?

[Brief 2-3 sentence explanation of WHG's purpose and value]

## Three Minute Tour

### 1. Search for a Place

**Goal**: Find historical information about a place you're interested in.

[Step-by-step instructions with screenshots]

- Navigate to the search interface
- Enter a place name (e.g., "Constantinople")
- Observe temporal range slider
- Click search
- Explore the results showing multiple attestations across time

**Key Insight**: WHG shows how places have been known differently across time and cultures.

### 2. Explore the Timeline

**Goal**: See how a place's attributes change over time.

[Instructions]

- Select a place from search results
- Navigate to the timeline view
- Observe name changes, geometric changes, type classifications over time
- Use temporal controls to animate changes

**Key Insight**: WHG is temporally aware - every assertion has a time context.

### 3. View the Map

**Goal**: Visualize spatial relationships and uncertainty.

[Instructions]

- Switch to map view
- Observe multiple geometries (points, polygons, uncertainty regions)
- Toggle different time periods
- See network connections if applicable

**Key Insight**: WHG captures spatial uncertainty and change.

## Common User Pathways

### For Researchers

**"I want to find all mentions of places in my study region during a specific period"**

→ Go to [Advanced Search](../search/advanced-search.md)

**"I want to trace trade routes or networks"**

→ See [Network Visualization](../maps/networks.md)

**"I need to cite this data in my publication"**

→ See [Citation & Attribution](../export/citation.md)

### For Data Contributors

**"I have a dataset of historical place names to contribute"**

→ Start with [Contribution Overview](../contributing/overview.md)

**"I want to link my data to WHG for reconciliation"**

→ See [Reconciliation Process](../contributing/reconciliation.md)

**"I've found an error in an existing record"**

→ See [Editing Interface](../editing/interface.md) or report via [issue tracker]

### For Educators

**"I want to create a collection for my class"**

→ See [Creating Collections](../collections/creating.md)

**"I need example datasets for teaching"**

→ Browse [Public Datasets](../collections/public-datasets.md)

## Core Concepts (5 Minute Read)

Before diving deeper, understand these key WHG concepts:

### Places as Subjects

WHG represents places as subjects that can have multiple:
- **Names** (toponyms in different languages, scripts, time periods)
- **Geometries** (locations that may change or be uncertain)
- **Types** (classifications like "city", "monastery", "battlefield")
- **Relations** (connections to other places)

### Attestations

Every piece of information in WHG is an **attestation** - a claim from a source. This means:
- Multiple sources can make different claims about the same place
- Conflicting information coexists
- Uncertainty is explicitly captured
- Provenance is always traceable

### Temporal Awareness

WHG is fundamentally temporal:
- Every attestation has a timespan
- Searches can be constrained by time
- Visualizations can animate temporal change
- "When was this true?" is as important as "Where was this?"

### Networks & Relations

Places exist in relationship:
- Trade routes connecting cities
- Itineraries showing movement through places
- Hierarchical relationships (part of, contains)
- Equivalence relationships (same as)

## Next Steps

Choose your path:

**I want to explore existing data**

**I want to understand the data model**
→ Read [Understanding WHG Concepts](concepts.md)

**I want to contribute data**
→ Start [Preparing Your Data](../contributing/preparation.md)

**I want to use the API**
→ Jump to [API Basics](../export/api-basics.md)

**I just want to browse around**
→ Try [Browsing Public Datasets](../collections/public-datasets.md)
