## Overview

A WHG place record is a rich, multi-faceted representation of a historical place. Unlike traditional gazetteers with fixed fields, WHG records are built from **attestations** - individual claims from sources that together form a comprehensive picture of a **Thing**.

## Record Sections

Every place record contains several sections:

1. **Header** - Summary and primary identity
2. **Names Tab** - All known names and variants
3. **Locations Tab** - Geometries and spatial information
4. **Temporal Tab** - When-related information
5. **Types & Classifications Tab** - What kind of Thing
6. **Relations Tab** - Connections to other Things
7. **Attestations Tab** - Source-level detail
8. **Provenance Tab** - Contribution and curation history

Let's explore each in detail.

## 1. Header Section

[Annotated screenshot of header]

The header provides at-a-glance information:

### Primary Name

**Display**: Largest text at top of record

**Logic**:
- Most recent name with highest certainty
- OR most commonly attested name
- OR editor-designated primary name

**Example**: For thing-Constantinople, primary name might be "Istanbul" (current) or "Constantinople" (historical dominance)

### Thing ID

**Display**: Small text below primary name (e.g., `whg:12345`)

**Purpose**: Unique permanent identifier for this Thing

**Use**: For citations, API queries, cross-referencing

### Quick Facts

**Display**: Icon-based summary below primary name

- **üìç Location**: Representative point or region
- **üìÖ Time Range**: Earliest to latest attestation
- **üèõÔ∏è Type**: Primary classification

## Understanding Record Quality

### Quality Indicators

**High Quality Record Has**:
- Multiple sources confirming core facts
- Detailed temporal information
- Precise geometries with uncertainty quantified
- Multiple name forms in original scripts
- Rich network relationships
- Clear certainty assessments
- Recent contributions/updates

**Lower Quality Record Has**:
- Single source
- Vague temporal bounds ("sometime in Middle Ages")
- Imprecise location ("somewhere in France")
- Only modern name
- No relationships
- Missing certainty assessments
- Stale data

**Visual Indicators in Interface**:
- Star rating or badge
- Completeness percentage
- Last updated date
- "Needs improvement" flag
- Community trust score

### How to Improve Record Quality

If you notice gaps:
1. Click "Edit" button
2. Add missing information
3. Provide sources
4. Assess certainty
5. Submit for review

See [Editing Interface](../editing/interface.md)

## Navigating Complex Records

### For Places with Many Attestations

**Use Filters**:
- Filter by time period
- Filter by certainty
- Filter by source
- Filter by attestation type

**Use Summary Views**:
- Collapse detailed attestations
- Show only primary name/geometry/etc.
- Timeline visualizations

### For Places with Conflicts

**Look for**:
- Conflict indicators (‚ö†Ô∏è icon)
- Certainty differences
- Temporal resolution (may apply to different periods)
- Source quality differences

**Don't Assume**:
- One source is "right" - evaluate evidence
- Conflicts are errors - often legitimate disagreement
- More sources = more certain - depends on source independence
