# Introduction

## Vision

Empowering discovery by connecting place names across time and language.

## Mission

The mission of the [World Historical Gazetteer](https://whgazetteer.org) is to build a platform for open linked historical place data in order to
foster deeper understanding of place history and to improve discovery of places that have had many names over time. The
WHG place index is accessible through tools and services that permit users to search and browse information about
places, augment and contribute their own place records, assemble and publish information about places, and use
information about places in teaching and communication.
