# World Historical Gazetteer Documentation

This repository contains the source files and build workflow for the **World Historical Gazetteer** documentation site.

The documentation is written in **Markdown** and **reStructuredText**, built with **Sphinx**, and automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages**.

**Live site:** <https://WorldHistoricalGazetteer.github.io/documentation/>

---

## Getting Started (Recommended)

The easiest way to contribute is by using a **GitHub Codespace**, which provides a pre-configured development environment with all dependencies already installed.

### 1. Launch Codespace

Click the "Code" button and select **"Open with Codespaces"** to launch a new, ready-to-use environment directly in your browser.

### 2. Edit and Preview

Once the Codespace loads, you can:

1.  **Edit existing documentation** files (Markdown or reStructuredText) or add new ones.
2.  **Build the documentation** from the terminal:
    ```bash
    make clean
    make html
    ```
3.  **Preview changes:** The Codespace will automatically detect the build output and prompt you to open a **"Simple Browser"** to view `_build/html/index.html`. If not, go to the **"Ports"** tab, find port `8000`, and click **"Open in Browser"**.

### 3. Commit and Push

1.  Use the **Source Control** view in the sidebar to stage and commit your changes.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Describe your documentation updates"
    ```
2.  Push your changes and create a **Pull Request** on GitHub to merge into the `main` branch.

## Local Development (Alternative)

If you prefer to work locally, ensure you have Python 3.9+ and Git installed.

1.  **Clone the repository and create a branch:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/documentation.git](https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/documentation.git)
    cd documentation
    git checkout -b my-doc-updates
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Build and view:**
    ```bash
    make clean
    make html
    # Open _build/html/index.html in your browser to check edits
    ```
4.  **Commit and push** your changes, then create a Pull Request.

## GitHub Actions Deployment

Once changes are merged into `main`:

* **GitHub Actions automatically:**
    1. Installs dependencies.
    2. Builds the Sphinx documentation.
    3. Deploys `_build/html` to the `gh-pages` branch.
    4. Updates the live GitHub Pages site.
* **No manual deployment is needed.**
