## Updating the Documentation

Your changes can be made locally or via the GitHub web interface.

### 1. Locally (recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/documentation.git](https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/documentation.git)
    cd documentation
    ```

2.  **Create a new branch for your changes:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-doc-updates
    ```

3.  **Edit existing Markdown files or add new ones.** Ensure the main landing page is named `index.md` (or `index.rst`).

4.  **Install dependencies** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Build the documentation locally to preview changes:**
    ```bash
    make clean
    make html
    ```
    Open `_build/html/index.html` in your browser to check your edits.

6.  **Commit and push your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update documentation"
    git push origin my-doc-updates
    ```

7.  **Create a pull request** on GitHub to merge your changes into `main`.

### 2. GitHub Actions Deployment

Once changes are merged into `main`:

* **GitHub Actions automatically:**
    1.  Installs dependencies.
    2.  Builds the Sphinx documentation.
    3.  Deploys `_build/html` to the `gh-pages` branch.
    4.  Updates the live GitHub Pages site.
* **No manual deployment is needed.**

---

### 3. Notes for Contributors

* Ensure your root document is named **`index.md`** or **`index.rst`**.
* Avoid committing **`_build/html/`** â€” it is generated automatically and ignored.
* Use consistent Markdown / reStructuredText formatting.
* Check the live preview locally before submitting pull requests.

---

### 4. Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Sphinx (installed via `requirements.txt`)
* Git

### 5. Helpful Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make html` | Build the documentation into `_build/html`. |
| `make clean` | Remove previous build files. |
| `git checkout -b <name>` | Create a new branch for your edits. |
| `git push origin <branch>` | Push changes to GitHub. |

This workflow ensures that all contributors can edit, preview, and deploy documentation safely and consistently.
